# Practice Python: Decorator Practice

Welcome to my Python practice project! This repository contains my exercises and experiments with Python decorators.

## Project Structure

- `decorator_practice.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing my practice code and explanations for various Python decorators.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this project, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/practice_python_decorators.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd practice_python_decorators
    ```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook decorator_practice.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions and run the cells to see the examples and practice exercises.

## Differences with Decorators

This repository includes examples of using decorators with and without memory caching. The key differences are:

- **With Memory Cache**: Decorators that store the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This can significantly improve performance for functions with heavy computations.
- **Without Memory Cache**: Standard decorators that do not store results and execute the function every time it is called, regardless of the inputs.
